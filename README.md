### Install

```
# Clone the repo to your local machine (This just clones, it does not "install")
$ git clone https://github.com/wssdll/modern-resume-theme-gh-pages.git

# Whichever directory you run the above command from, that directory should
# now have a folder called `modern-resume-theme-gh-pages`.

# Change directory to the `modern-resume-theme-gh-pages` folder:
$ cd modern-resume-theme-gh-pages

# Install and run. Make sure you do these two commands from within the `modern-resume-theme-gh-pages` folder:
# Make sure you have installed Ruby.
$ jekyll serve

# Here is how to encrypt the code:
$ npm install
$ npm start

# Now you can see the file `resume` in path `_site/template`

# If you have issues, read below.
